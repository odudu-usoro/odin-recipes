    <h3>Spaghetti Bolongnese</h3>

    <p>
        Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese) is a pasta dish that is popular outside Italy, 
        but not part of traditional Bolognese or even Italian cuisine in general.
        The dish is generally perceived as inauthentic when encountered by Italians abroad
    </p>

    <p>
        It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and herbs; sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats.
        In this sense the sauce is actually more similar to Neapolitan ragù from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of ragù.
