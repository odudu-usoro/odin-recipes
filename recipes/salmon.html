    <h3>Maple Salmon</h3>

    <p>
        Maple Glazed Salmon recipe is a great main course for entertaining or for serving any night of the week because it uses just a few simple ingredients and takes very little prep time. 
        Even still, it has tons of bold ginger, soy and maple flavor that pairs beautifully with the tender and buttery salmon!
