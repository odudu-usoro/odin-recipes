    <h3>Pan Seared Steak</h3>

    <p>
        This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality.
        You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Spices and Herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Direction</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness </li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
